# Graph TV

## https://graphtv.devbrown.com

## Description

An attempted recreation of this website: http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/. It unfortunately went offline a while ago
and newer sites don't look as nice. This one needs a bit more work but the general functionality is the same.

The aim is to be able to search for a TV show and have all its seasons ratings shown on a pretty graph. It should be
easy to use and have a simplistic design.

## Stack

The app is powered by Next JS. I'm using Tailwind CSS for styling and D3 to draw a (hopefully) pretty graph.

Search and results are powered by [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Thanks for a great API!
